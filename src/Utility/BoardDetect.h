// **** NOTE: internal codes do not match user codes ****
// internal codes follow the evoloution of discovering that the intial analog input
// could not be used and had to be swapped with GPIOin1 :-(
// the the easier to build PCB with no GPIO!
// The User IDs make more logical sense:
//   V2.0 base no GPIO
//   V2.1 only digital IO 
//   V2.2 full GPIO
#define BRD_V1_FULLGPIO    10
#define BRD_V2_GPIO_NOALG  20   // original V20 board - no cut traces - analog on wrong pin :-(
#define BRD_V2_FULLGPIO    21   // V2 board cut traces tranposed GPIO1 & Analog
#define BRD_V2_NOGPIO      22   // V2 board forced short on analog input - NO GPIO mode
#define BRD_V3_GPIO_NOALG  30   // V3 board - no cut traces - analog input grounded
